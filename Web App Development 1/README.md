JSON Collection for Rare Gaming Consoles Website

This JSON structure organizes data about rare gaming consoles,
categorizing them by manufacturer, console type, and specific models.

Each manufacturer has a list of consoles, and each console type
includes a list of models with details such as name, color, release date,
bundle information, and additional details.

JSON model idea based off of https://consolevariations.com/ and some info taken from consolevariations.com and https://www.serebii.net/games/consoles.shtml
