    <p>Computers & Technology have always been a big part of my life for many years and are the reason why I'm learning to do programming.</p>
    <p>I grew up with a computer when I was 5-6 years old, playing Solitaire and Inkball on it with the preloaded games on Windows Vista because we didn't have internet access at the time.</p>
    <p>When I was able to access the internet, it opened up a whole new world for me. Playing online Flash games and using websites like Google and YouTube was incredible for me and that's when I started to really become fascinated with computers.</p>
    <p>When I was 9, I got myself a Compaq notebook laptop, it was installed with Windows XP and along with a SIM card mobile USB dongle I got from my parents, I was using the limited data I had to do all sorts of stuff to my laptop. Downloading new apps, games, toolbars, images. It was great and I loved it a lot. Sadly that laptop got stolen so I no longer have it.</p>
    <p>I then got another Toshiba laptop a few years later after I moved house. This one was bigger and had a DVD drive so I also got some DVDs to watch on it. It came with Windows 8 which was fine until I messed up the bootloader for the OS so it wouldn't run properly. I took it to this "laptop repair" because I didn't know how to repair it myself at the time. They overcharged way too much and what I got was a bigger capacity hard drive with Windows 7 on it.</p>
    <p>So I used Windows 7 for many years until I was able to get another laptop as a present because the one I had was starting to be really slow with its weak and outdated hardware.</p>
    <p>These days, I know much more about computers than I did when I was a kid. I was able to save up my own money and buy my own laptop which is a very high spec one and it runs much better than the old laptops I used to use.</p>
